# avtoradio_control_bot
Bot controlling the work of the department

preparation for launch v.1.01:
1.Open config.py:
  -add bot token
  -add folder_b (//folder_bot) #in future versions the program will mirror a network folder in automatic mode; 
  now this functionality is not available
  -add db_name (opcional)

2.Terminal:
  -Set up a virtual environment
  -In the terminal, run the command pip install -> requirements.txt.
    This will install all the project dependencies.

3.Run:
  -Start main.py
  #When the bot first starts, a database structure is created. 
  It is important that the author is the first user of the bot. 
  In this case, he receives administrator rights and becomes the owner of the bot. Just press /start and everything will work out.

It works, goodluck
